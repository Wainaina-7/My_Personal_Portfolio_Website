              <h1>Hi there i'm Peter</h1>
              <p>
  Hello! I'm a passionate Software Engineer currently honing my craft at <strong>Moringa School</strong>. <br>
  Check out my github page.

</p>
 <h2>Beyond the Code</h2>
  <p>
    Outside of programming, I'm all about pushing limits — physically, mentally, and mechanically.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm passionate about mixed martial arts — not just as a sport, but as a mindset. The discipline, strategy, and toughness required in the cage translate directly into how I approach challenges in life and work.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm also into firearms and marksmanship. I respect the responsibility that comes with handling weapons and enjoy learning the mechanics behind different platforms. It's a skill that demands focus, precision, and patience — values I apply in every project I take on.
  </p>
  <p>
    When it comes to machines, I've got a serious love for trucks and racing. Whether it's wrenching under the hood, tearing through off-road trails, or following motorsports, I'm all about power, performance, and the freedom that comes with it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Travel ties it all together. New places, new cultures, and new roads to explore keep me grounded and curious. Whether I'm on a trail, a highway, or a flight path — I'm always chasing experience, not just destinations.
